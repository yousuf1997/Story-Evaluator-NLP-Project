As a little girl, Emily had always loved playing with her grandmother's antique dollhouse. It was a beautiful and intricate replica of their family's ancestral home, and Emily spent countless hours arranging the miniature furniture and dolls just so. One day, when Emily was all grown up, her grandmother passed away, leaving her the dollhouse in her will. Emily was overjoyed to finally have the dollhouse all to herself. But as she was dusting off the little figures inside, she noticed something strange. The dolls had moved from their previous positions, and one of them was missing entirely. Emily was confused, but shrugged it off as a trick of her imagination. However, as the days went by, she became more and more convinced that something strange was happening with the dollhouse. The dolls continued to move on their own, and Emily swore she could hear whispers and laughter coming from the miniature rooms. Finally, Emily had had enough. She took a closer look at the missing doll, and realized it was a tiny version of herself. Suddenly, it all clicked into place. The dollhouse was not a replica of their ancestral home, but a miniature version of Emily's own house, complete with all the family members, including herself. She had been playing with her own life all along, and now it was playing back.
