Alice was a successful businesswoman who had it all: a high-paying job, a beautiful home, and a loving husband. However, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from her life. One day, Alice's husband surprised her with tickets to a tropical paradise. They spent the first few days lounging on the beach and exploring the local sights. On the fourth day, Alice's husband suggested they take a hike to a secluded waterfall. As they made their way through the jungle, Alice's husband suddenly stopped and turned to her. I have a confession to make, he said, his face pale. I've been having an affair. Alice's world came crashing down around her. She had suspected that something was off, but never in a million years did she think her husband would cheat on her. As she tried to process the news, she heard a rustling in the bushes behind them. Suddenly, a group of armed men burst out of the foliage and held them at gunpoint. It turned out that Alice's husband had been involved in some shady business dealings, and now they were both in grave danger.
