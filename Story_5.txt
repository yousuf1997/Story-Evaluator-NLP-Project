Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Alice who lived in a small village. One day, while walking through the forest, she stumbled upon a strange-looking key. Excited by her discovery, Alice searched high and low for the lock that the key would fit. Finally, after hours of searching, she found an old door hidden in the bushes. With trembling hands, she inserted the key and turned it slowly. To her surprise, the door creaked open to reveal a staircase leading down into the darkness. Brimming with curiosity, Alice descended the stairs and soon found herself in a vast underground chamber filled with glittering jewels and precious artifacts. Just as she was about to pick up a gleaming diamond, she heard footsteps approaching. Suddenly, a tall figure emerged from the shadows, brandishing a sword. It was the fierce dragon who had guarded the treasure for centuries! With a gasp, Alice realized that she was in mortal danger. But instead of fleeing, she stood her ground and looked the dragon straight in the eye. To her amazement, the dragon lowered its sword and spoke in a gentle voice. I have been waiting for someone like you for a long time, it said. Someone brave enough to face me and claim the treasure. You have passed the test, Alice. The treasure is yours.
