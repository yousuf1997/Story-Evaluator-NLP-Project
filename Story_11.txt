As a child, Lily loved exploring the woods behind her house. She would often spend hours wandering through the trees, picking wildflowers, and watching the animals. But as she grew older, she became busy with school and other activities, and the woods became a distant memory.One day, as an adult, she decided to take a walk through the woods again. As she made her way down the familiar path, she noticed a dark cloud looming on the horizon. She didn't think much of it at first, but as she walked further into the woods, the sky grew darker, and the wind began to pick up.Suddenly, a branch snapped overhead, and Lily looked up to see a large tree falling towards her. She had no time to react and was hit by the falling tree, knocking her to the ground. She was lucky to survive the accident, but it left her with a deep fear of the woods and the dangers that lurked within.Looking back, Lily realized that the dark cloud on the horizon was a warning of the storm that was about to hit, and the snap of the branch was a foreshadowing of the danger that was to come. She vowed to never underestimate the power of nature again, and to always be prepared for the unexpected.
