As the young couple strolled hand in hand through the park, a gust of wind whipped through the trees, sending a chill down their spines. It was as if the very air around them was trying to warn them of something sinister lurking just out of sight. But they shrugged off the feeling, dismissing it as nothing more than their overactive imaginations. They were in love, after all, and nothing could dampen their spirits. As they continued on their way, the clouds overhead grew darker and more ominous. A few drops of rain began to fall, followed by a rumble of thunder that echoed through the park. Still, the couple remained undaunted. They laughed and danced in the rain, oblivious to the danger that lurked just around the corner. But then, out of nowhere, a bolt of lightning struck a nearby tree, sending splinters flying in every direction. The couple shrieked and stumbled backwards, their hearts racing with fear. As they looked up at the sky, they realized that they had been foolish to ignore the warning signs. The clouds had been a deep shade of gray, the wind had been howling, and the air had been charged with electricity. All of the lesser words of foreshadowing had been there, but they had ignored them, too caught up in their own happiness to pay attention. As they huddled together, waiting for the storm to pass, they knew that they had been lucky. They had narrowly escaped disaster, but they had learned an important lesson. From now on, they would pay closer attention to the world around them, for they knew that the smallest details could hold the greatest warnings.
