Lena was a young girl who lived in a small village at the edge of a dense forest. She loved to explore the woods and often spent her afternoons wandering among the trees. One day, while she was out on a walk, she noticed a strange feeling in the air. It was as if the forest was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. As Lena walked deeper into the woods, she began to see signs of danger. Trees were toppled over, and the underbrush was trampled down. The forest animals were nowhere to be seen, and the silence was eerie. Lena could feel her heart racing as she realized that something terrible had happened. As she continued on her path, Lena saw a shadow moving in the distance. It was too dark to make out what it was, but she knew that it wasn't human. She tried to turn back, but it was too late. The shadow was upon her, and Lena found herself face to face with a fearsome creature she had never seen before. Lena fought for her life, but the creature was too strong. She managed to escape, but she knew that she would never be the same again. From that day on, Lena never ventured into the forest alone, and the villagers whispered of the dangers that lurked in the woods. Years later, when Lena was an old woman, the village was attacked by a pack of savage beasts. Lena knew that they were the same creatures that had attacked her all those years ago. She fought bravely alongside the other villagers, but in the end, they were all killed. As Lena lay dying, she realized that the foreshadowing she had felt all those years ago had been a warning of the terrible fate that awaited her village.
